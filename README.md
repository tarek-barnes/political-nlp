Checklist.ipynb - a high-level overview of my initial plan / thought process. I didn't end up following this through exactly, but generally.

Clustering.ipynb - TSNE / Kmeans on the topics I'd generated from publications.

Fletcher_EDA.ipynb - EDA. Much of this is similar to what's in Fletcher_Main.

Fletcher_Main.ipynb - The main work. I added different notebooks because I hit a point where I was running out of memory.

Visualization.ipynb - This is where I prepared most of the visuzalizations I used outside from Tableau.
